      <h1>Flex Box Tutorial</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Soon after the creation of the World Wide Web, it became apparent that websites needed styling for readability
          and
          design. For those reasons, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" , target="blank">Cascading
            Style Sheets</a> (CSS) were invented. These days, CSS is used on most websites.
          Spacing
          and alignment is essential to design, and there are many ways accomplish this in CSS. One of those is called a
          flex box.
          As described in the name, a CSS flex box is flexible and is generally used as a dynamic way to align and
          resize
          content.
          Although flex boxes are a relatively new addition to CSS, they are supported in <a
            href="https://caniuse.com/?search=flex" target="blank">all major browsers</a>. In this tutorial, I will show
          you how to create and use the flex property to position data in rows and columns. By the end you should be
          able to create a simple column layout using CSS flex boxes.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Flex Containers</h2>
        <p>
          HTML has several elements that are meant to hold other elements inside of them, such as <em
            class="code">&ltdiv&gt</em> ,
          <em class="code">&ltarticle&gt</em>, <em class="code">&ltsection&gt</em>, and <em
            class="code">&ltform&gt</em>. When an item is
          placed in one of these containers, the item is positioned
          according
          to the rules and styles of that container. If one of these containers is styled as a flex display, these
          “container” elements become flex boxes. To do this, assign <em class='code'>display: flex</em> style to the
          container element that you want to become a flex box.
        </p>
        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <p>By default, block items each start on a new line in HTML. Items that are placed in a flex container, however,
          are positioned in a horizonal row. Items wrapped in a flex container are called flex items. Below
          is a <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="blank">CodePen</a> example of a flex container with three flex
          items. Click on the "CSS" button to see the code. Feel free to change the code and experiement.
        </p>

        <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="MWOvwjX" data-editable="true"
          data-user="josiahstephens"
          style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
          <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/josiahstephens/pen/MWOvwjX">
              Flex Box Part 1</a> by JJ Stephens (<a href="https://codepen.io/josiahstephens">@josiahstephens</a>)
            on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

        <p>As you can see, the items are in a row. If you don't want the container to align the items horizontally, just
          add
          <em class="code">flex-direction:
            column</em>
          after <em class="code">display: flex</em> and the items will be displayed vertically.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Spacing</h2>
        <p>
          In the example above the flex items were placed right next to each other, but usually there will need
          to
          be some spacing added to make the content more readable. One method to accomplish this is <em
            class="code">justify-content</em>. This attribute controls the spacing in the direction of the flexbox.
          There are three main ways of spacing out items with <em class="code">justify-content</em>:
        </p>
        <dl class="justify-content-definitions">
          <div>
            <dt>Space between</dt>
            <dd>Puts space between every flex item, but no spacing between the edge of the flex box and the
              items on the edge.</dd>
          </div>
          <div>
            <dt>Space around</dt>
            <dd>Puts the same amount of spacing around each item. Since the edges of the container do not get
              spacing, this means that the items on the edge of the container will have half as much spacing between
              them
              and
              the edge compared to the other items in the container.</dd>
          </div>
          <div>
            <dt>Space evenly</dt>
            <dd>This is very similar to the space around property, but it puts the same amount of spacing between
              each item — including the edges.</dd>
          </div>
        </dl>
        <p>
          No one style of spacing is perfect for every situation, but between the three of them you can usually find
          something that will work for your situation.
        </p>

          style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p>
          Justify content can be used to align content in a flex container as well. The alignment options for <em
            class="code">justify-content</em> are flex-start, flex-end, and
          center. But, if you use <em class="code">justify-content</em> to align items, you will not be able to use it
          to put spacing in
          between
          items. To fix this, CSS developers added a gap property to flex boxes. Gap is a flex property that will add a
          gap of a certain distance between each flex item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes it is necessary to align items in the opposite direction of the flex box. To do this, use <em
            class="code">align-items</em>.
          Like <em class="code">justify-content</em>, <em class="code">align-items</em> can be set to flex-start,
          flex-end, and center. This is especially useful
          when
          trying to align images and text contained in the same flex container.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Wrap</h2>
        <p>
          As you start to add more content to your flex container, the container can fill up and overflow. This can make
          your site look really bad. Splitting the content into more flex boxes is an option, but this isn't a great
          choice because the whole point of flex boxes is that they are dynamic, meaning that they can adapt to
          different situations. One option to solve this problem is <em class="code">flex-wrap</em>, which will wrap
          overflowing content onto the next line. <em class="code">Wrap-reverse</em> is also an option, which wraps in
          the opposite direction as normal. In the example below, click on the CSS button and try changing the code from
          <em class="code">wrap</em> to <em class="code">wrap-reverse</em> or
          <em class="code">nowrap</em> and see what happens.
        </p>


        <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="YzExXbZ" data-editable="true"
          data-user="josiahstephens"
          style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
          <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/josiahstephens/pen/YzExXbZ">
              Flex Box Part 3</a> by JJ Stephens (<a href="https://codepen.io/josiahstephens">@josiahstephens</a>)
            on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
        <p>
          Wrap, like the other flex properties, is dynamic. This means that if a user resizes the window, the flex items
          will rearrange based on how much room is available. If you were making a gallery of pictures, for example,
          using
          flex wrap would make it so that the pictures move to the next line before they are cut off from the view.
        </p>
        <h2>Flex Containers in Flex Containers</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes a single flex box isn't enough to get your content to look exactly how you would like it. In these
          cases, a good option is to embed flex containers in other flex containers. Flex
          containers can hold other flex containers inside of them. The embedded flex container acts as a flex
          item in the parent container. Below is an example of a situation where this could be useful.
        </p>
        <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="JjOyYGK" data-editable="true"
          data-user="josiahstephens"
          style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
          <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/josiahstephens/pen/JjOyYGK">

        <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
        <p>
          As you can probably tell, using flex containers inside of other flex containers can be very powerful. Dynamic
          menus, forms, and articles can be quickly and easily made with only a few lines of code.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Flex Item Properties</h2>
        <p>
          Some flex properties should be applied directly to flex items inside of flex boxes instead of to the
          containers
          themselves. These properties include <em class="code">flex-grow</em>, <em class="code">flex-shrink</em>, <em
            class="code">flex-basis</em>, and <em class="code">order</em>. The former two (<em
            class="code">flex-grow</em> and <em class="code">flex-shrink</em>)
          basically tell the browser to try to make the items change size if possible. In the example below, I added the
          flex-grow property in the CSS code. This made the “contact info” and “things I like to do” grow to fill
          the container if there is room to grow. Similarly flex-shrink allows items to shrink if there is not enough
          room
          in the container.
        </p>
        <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="ExbwKmO" data-editable="true"
          data-user="josiahstephens"
          style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
          <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/josiahstephens/pen/ExbwKmO">
              Flex Box Part 5</a> by JJ Stephens (<a href="https://codepen.io/josiahstephens">@josiahstephens</a>)
            on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
        <p>
          Often <em class="code">flex-grow</em> and <em class="code">flex-shrink</em> will be enough for you to
          accomplish your design goals, but sometimes you need
          to be more specific. <em class="code">Flex-basis</em> is an option that allows you to indicate exactly what
          percent of the flex
          container you want the item to fill. I often use this property with images because often images seem to be too
          large or too small in the flex box. This is an efficient way to ensure that they stay a good size.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the order of items in a flex box, add the <em class="code">order</em> attribute to a flex child.
          This is useful for when
          you
          want items to appear in a different order than they appear in the HTML. To use <em class="code">order</em>,
          you need to assign
          it
          a value. This value corresponds to the index at which you want the item to appear. Add <em class="code">order:
            2</em> to the CSS
          section of the example above. Notice how the order changes.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          You should now be able to create a simple column layout using flex boxes! There are many ways to resize,
          align,
          and space content on a website. Flex is a new and powerful way to accomplish dynamic layouts quickly and
          easily.
          By using flex boxes, web designers can create professional designs that look good on any window size.

        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/" target="blank">CSS Flex Box documentation</a> covers flex
          boxes in complete
          detail. The documentation covers everything that
          I
          was not able to cover in this tutorial, including <em class="code">order</em>, <em
            class="code">flex-grow</em>, <em class="code">flex-shrink</em>, and <em class="code">flex-basis</em>. This
          site is
          somewhat technical but will be very helpful for people who already have a good knowledge of CSS.

          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex" target="blank">Mozilla</a> has a very
          comprehensive website that explains everything about CSS. The general description of flex
          boxes is very good, and is more beginner oriented. They also give code examples to show you how to use
          different
          flex properties and the syntax associated with them. This is the best resource I found to describe flex boxes
          in
          general.

          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="blank">CSS Tricks</a> gives a
          beginner guide to flex boxes that helped me learn a lot about them. They explain alignment
          very well through examples and graphic depictions. The section on <em class="code">gap</em> is especially good
          and will help someone
          who is struggling to grasp exactly how it works.

          first introduction to flex boxes was through Flexbox Froggy. The game has 24 levels that go over the basics of
          flex
          box, including <em class="code">justify-content</em> and <em class="code">align-items</em>. It is a really
          good resource for somebody who has never made a flex box.
